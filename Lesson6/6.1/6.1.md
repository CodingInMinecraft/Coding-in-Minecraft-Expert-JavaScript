## Step 1 @unplugged
  
Within JavaScript, there are multiple forms of 'for' loops to perform different loop functions. The `for...in` loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It allows you to loop through the keys or property names of an object, giving you access to each key in each iteration. Here's how it works:

```javascript
    for (variable in object) { // code to be executed }
```
Let's break down the parts of the `for...in` loop:

-   `variable`: A variable that represents the key or property name in each iteration.
-   `object`: The object whose properties you want to iterate over.

```javascript
    const person = { 
    name: "John", 
    age: 25, 
    occupation: "Engineer" 
    }; 

for (let key in person) { 
console.log(key + ": " + person[key]); 
}
```
In this example, we have an object `person` with properties like `name`, `age`, and `occupation`. The `for...in` loop allows us to iterate over the properties of `person` and access their values. In each iteration, the `key` variable represents the property name.
`


## Step 2

Test the code to see how the code will output using the player.say command.

  ```template
  

    const person = { name: "John", age: 25, occupation: "Engineer" }; for (let key in person) { console.log(key + ": " + person[key]); }

```

  

## Step 3


Note that the order in which the properties are iterated is not guaranteed in JavaScript. If the order of iteration is important, consider using an array or a Map instead.

It's important to keep in mind that the `for...in` loop is specifically designed for objects. If you want to iterate over the elements of an array or a collection, the `for...in` loop is not recommended. Instead, you should use the `for` loop or other iteration methods like `forEach` or `for...of` loop.
