## Step 1 @unplugged

  

Let's use	some 'for-of' loops to identify the blocks in the building in front of you. First we need to figure out the coordinates of the building, to get the dimensions. Figure out the starting and ending XYZ coordinates relative to your agent's starting block.

#### ~ tutorialhint

  

```javascript

let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

  

```


## Step 2

Now, we need to use a 'for-of' loop to set parameters on where to inspect. Let's add a loop for each of the X, Y, and Z coordinates that defines the blocks.range of each.


  

#### ~ tutorialhint

  

```javascript
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

for (let x of blocks.range(startX, endX)) { 			 		for (let y of blocks.range(startY, endY)) { 	for (let z of blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) {

  

```

  

## Step 3

Great! Now let's use the variable currentBlock to have our agent inspect the blocks in the given X, Y, Z range defined previously. Use the agent.inspect function.



#### ~ tutorialhint


```javascript
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

for (let x of blocks.range(startX, endX)) { 			 		for (let y of blocks.range(startY, endY)) { 	for (let z of blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) {

let currentBlock = agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, x, y, z).block;  

```

  
  

## Step 4

For our last step, we need to add in an "if" statement that uses player.say to let us know if our desired block type is present. Use an operator that shows equivalence of the currentBlock and targetBlock, and then add in a function that makes your player say "Found a 'targetBlock' at X, Y, Z).


#### ~ tutorialhint
  

```javascript
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

for (let x of blocks.range(startX, endX)) { 			 		for (let y of blocks.range(startY, endY)) { 	for (let z of blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) {

let currentBlock = agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, x, y, z).block;  

if (currentBlock === targetBlock) { player.say("Found a " + targetBlock + " block at X: " + x + " Y: " + y + " Z: " + z); } } } }

```

  
  

## Step 5 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
