## Step 1 @unplugged

  The `do-while` loop in JavaScript is a type of loop that executes a block of code at least once, and then repeats the execution as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. It is similar to the `while` loop, but the key difference is that the `do-while` loop guarantees the execution of the code block at least once, even if the condition is initially `false`. Let's dive into the details of the `do-while` loop:

    do 
    // code to be executed
    } while (condition);




## Step 2

Here's how the `do-while` loop works:

1.  The code block within the `do` statement is executed first.
2.  Then, the condition is checked.
3.  If the condition evaluates to `true`, the loop will execute the code block again. If the condition evaluates to `false`, the loop will terminate, and the program will continue with the code that follows the loop.

It's important to note that the condition is checked after the code block is executed. This guarantees that the code block is executed at least once, regardless of the initial condition. If the condition is initially `false`, the code block will still run once.

Let's explore some examples to better understand the usage of the `do-while` loop.


  

## Step 3

In this example, the `do-while` loop is used to count from 1 to 5. The loop first executes the code block, which prints the value of `i`. Then, it increments `i` by 1. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5. Let's run the code and see what happens.

  ```template

    let i = 1;

    do {
      player.SAY(i);
      i++;
    } while (i <= 5);

```


## Step 4 @unplugged

Run your code, and watch your agent move forward and place a block each of the 10 moves. 

  


## Step 5 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
