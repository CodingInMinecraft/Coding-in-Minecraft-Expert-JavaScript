# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 6 Activity 6.8

## Step 1 @unplugged

 Now that we have identified the blocks in the structure, let's modify some of them. We want to use the code from the previous activity to replace the stone blocks, with brick blocks (blocks.brick_block). To do this, we need a variable called replacementBlock that we will need to define, and we will need to add in an agent.place to run the function that replaces our block. Use the template below to figure out where to put in the two new lines of code.


  ```template

    
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 
let targetBlock = blocks.stone;\

for (let x of blocks.range(startX, endX)) { 			 		for (let y of blocks.range(startY, endY)) { 	for (let z of blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) {

let currentBlock = agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, x, y, z).block;  

if (currentBlock === targetBlock) { player.say("Found a " + targetBlock + " block at X: " + x + " Y: " + y + " Z: " + z); } } } }

```

```javascript
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 
let targetBlock = blocks.stone;\
let replacementBlock = blocks.brick_block;

for (let x of blocks.range(startX, endX)) { 			 		for (let y of blocks.range(startY, endY)) { 	for (let z of blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) {

let currentBlock = agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, x, y, z).block;  

if (currentBlock === targetBlock) { player.say("Found a " + targetBlock + " block at X: " + x + " Y: " + y + " Z: " + z);
agent.place(replacementBlock, positions.create(x, y, z)); } } } }

```

  
  



## Step 5 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when you see the text "Found a targetBlock at location!"

  
  
  

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.
  
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
