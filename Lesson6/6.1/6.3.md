## Step 1 @unplugged

In JavaScript, the **for...of loop** is like a helpful tool that helps us go through different iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. It makes it easy to check out the items in a group without needing to remember their order (using indices). Now, let's take a closer look at how this for...of loop works:

**Choose a List:** First, you have a list of things you want to work with. This list can be an array of numbers, a string of text, or other collections of items.

**Set Up the Loop:** Here is what the code looks like:

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for (let number of numbers) {
    // Perform an action for each number
    basic.showNumber(number)
    basic.pause(1000)

**Go Through the List:** The loop starts at the beginning of your list and looks at the first item. It does something with that item, like showing it on the screen, and then moves on to the next item in your list.

**Keep Going Until Done:** The loop continues this process until it reaches the end of the list. It stops when it has looked at every item in the list.

**Do Something with Each Item:** In each round of the loop, you can do something with the current item. For example, you can print it, perform a calculation, or use it in your program.



## Step 2


Let's explore some examples to better understand the usage of `for...of` loop:

We are going to iterate this over an array. 

Arrays are used to store collections of items, which can be of different types (e.g., numbers, strings, objects). In JavaScript, you can create an array by starting with the word let and then assigning it a name. Then put the items inside square brackets [].

For example: let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Type the above array into the coding editor. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
   ```javascript

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```



## Step 3

Next, begin the for...of loop which begins with the word for followed by parentheses. 

In a "for...of" loop, you specify two things inside the parentheses:

A **variable** (e.g., let number): This is a new variable that you create to represent each item in the array or iterable object. In each iteration of the loop, this variable takes on the value of the current item in the array. You can choose any name you like for this variable.

The **iterable object** (e.g., numbers): This is the array or collection you want to loop through. The loop will go through each item in this collection one by one.

For example: 

for (let number of numbers) {
       
}
Type the above code below after the array. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
   ```javascript

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for (let number of numbers) {
    
}
```

## Step 4
  Lastly, add the code that has the player will say the variable.

  #### ~ tutorialhint
   ```javascript

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for (let number of numbers) {
    player.say(number)
    
}
```

2. You will know your code is correct when your player counts from numbers 1 - 5 on the screen. 

## Step 7

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
