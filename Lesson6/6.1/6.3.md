The `for...of` loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, and more. It provides a convenient way to loop through the elements of a collection without the need to access them using indices. Let's dive into the details of the `for...of` loop:

    for (variable of iterable) {// code to be executed
}

Here's a breakdown of the parts of the `for...of` loop:

-   `variable`: A variable that represents the current element in each iteration.
-   `iterable`: The iterable object (e.g., an array, string, map, set) to be looped over.

The `for...of` loop automatically retrieves the values of the iterable object in each iteration and assigns them to the variable specified.


## Step 2


Let's explore some examples to better understand the usage of `for...of` loop:

1. Iterating over an array 

   ```javascript

     const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    for (let number of numbers) {
      console.log(number);
    }

Enter in the code above and run note the output. Add a player.say command.

```javascript

  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    for (let number of numbers) {
      console.log(number);
    }
    player.say(number)

```  

## Step 3


In this example, the `for...of` loop iterates over each element of the `numbers` array and prints its value. The loop automatically assigns each element to the `number` variable in each iteration. The output would have shown numbers 1-5 in an array.
