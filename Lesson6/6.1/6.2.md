# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 6 Activity 6.2
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged

For this activity, we are going to use 'for-in' loops to count and categorize the animals you see in front of you. First, we need to define the coordinates of the area, relative to where your agent is standing. You will need a start and end coordinate for X and Z, and one coordinate for the Y (height) of the animal pen.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let startX = ;
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endZ = ; 
let startY = ; 

```


## Step 2

Now, we need to define variables to count the animal types. let's create an animalCount variable for each of the four animals in front of us (cow, pug, sheep, chicken), and set them to zero.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

let cowCount = 0;
let pigCount = 0;
let sheepCount = 0;
let chickenCount = 0;

```
  

## Step 3

Great! Now let's use some 'for-in' loops to begin searching for the animals using our coordinate data. You will need a loop for each of the coordinates (X, Y, and Z). I will show you the first one, and you will add in the other two. 
for (let x in blocks.range(startX, endX)) 





#### ~ tutorialhint

  

```javascript
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

let cowCount = 0;
let pigCount = 0;
let sheepCount = 0;
let chickenCount = 0;

for (let x in blocks.range(startX, endX)) { for (let z in blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) { for (let y in blocks.range(startY, startY + 1)) {
  

```

  

## Step 4

For our next step, we need to add in some instructions that count our animals for us. In the template below, you will see one example for counting the Minecraft cow. Using the template, add in some code that will count pigs, sheep, and chickens as well.

```template
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

let cowCount = 0;
let pigCount = 0;
let sheepCount = 0;
let chickenCount = 0;

for (let x in blocks.range(startX, endX)) { for (let z in blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) { for (let y in blocks.range(startY, startY + 1)) {
let entity = agent.detect(AgentDetection.Entities, positions.createWorld(x, y, z)); if (entity) { let entityType = entity.entityType; switch (entityType) { case  "minecraft:cow": cowCount++; break;

```

#### ~ tutorialhint
  

```javascript
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

let cowCount = 0;
let pigCount = 0;
let sheepCount = 0;
let chickenCount = 0;

for (let x in blocks.range(startX, endX)) { for (let z in blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) { for (let y in blocks.range(startY, startY + 1)) {
let entity = agent.detect(AgentDetection.Entities, positions.createWorld(x, y, z)); if (entity) { let entityType = entity.entityType; switch (entityType) { case  "minecraft:cow": cowCount++; break;
}}}}}
```

  
## Step 5  

Lastly, let's add in a few player.say commands that will tell us the animal and the number present once our code is ran. use player.say("Animal:" + animalCount);

You'll need a command for each animal.


#### ~ tutorialhint
  

```javascript
let startX = ;
let startY = ; 
let startZ = ; 
let endX = ; 
let endY = ; 
let endZ = ; 

let cowCount = 0;
let pigCount = 0;
let sheepCount = 0;
let chickenCount = 0;

for (let x in blocks.range(startX, endX)) { for (let z in blocks.range(startZ, endZ)) { for (let y in blocks.range(startY, startY + 1)) {
let entity = agent.detect(AgentDetection.Entities, positions.createWorld(x, y, z)); if (entity) { let entityType = entity.entityType; switch (entityType) { case  "minecraft:cow": cowCount++; break;
}}}}}
player.say("Cows: " + cowCount); player.say("Pigs: " + pigCount); player.say("Sheep: " + sheepCount); player.say("Chickens: " + chickenCount);
```

2. You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 7

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
