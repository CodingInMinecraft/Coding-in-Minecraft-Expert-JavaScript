# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 9 Activity 9.2.1
### @explicitHints true


## Step 1

In the last activity, you built a code that used a conditional statement.  We are now going to build a code that instead uses a Boolean expression to do the same thing. 
Some of the code will be the same.  Let's build that first. 

First, declare 2 variables. One named score with the value of 0 and the other named endGame the value of an empty string (" ").  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""

``` 

## Step 2

Next, create a code that when a grass blocks is placed, the variable score increases by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})

```

## Step 3

Now, create an on chat command named scoreCheck.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {
)
})

```

## Step 4

Now, this is where the code will be different as you will use a Boolean expression.  
Create the if /else statement and check is the variable score is greater than 5.  If it is, set the variable endgame to equal to true.  If it is not, set the variable endgame to false. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {
	if  (score >  5)  {
		endGame =  "True"
	}  else  {
		endGame =  "False"
	}
})

```

## Step 5

Now, after the if / else statement inside the on chat command, add the code that has the player say the variable endGame. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score =  0
let endGame =  ""
blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {
	score +=  1
})
player.onChat("scoreCheck",  function  ()  {
	if  (score >  5)  {
		endGame =  "True"
	}  else  {
		endGame =  "False"
	}
	player.say(endGame)
})

```

## Step 6

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 7 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Place down some grass blocks. 
3. Open the chat by pressing T and enter scoreCheck.  
4. You will know your code is correct if your players says True if you placed more than 5 blocks down or False if you placed 5 or less. 

## Step 8
When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
