## Step 1 @unplugged

Algorithms can be created from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms. Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones. Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another algorithm 
has benefits such as reducing development time, reducing testing, and simplifying the identification of errors.

## Step 2

We are going to practice this by first reviewing an algorithm that builds a 5x5 square.  
Run the code below to see how it works.  

```template
    player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	    agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	    for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
		    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		}
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	})
	
```
## Step 3

Now that you understand how that algorithm works, let's use that knowledge to create a new algorithm that builds a pyramid with 3 levels, the middle level, being a 5 x 5 square.  

We know the code to build a 5x5 square and already have it below.  We will now need to use it and our knowledge of how it works to build a pyramid. If the middle layer is 5x5, we want the bottom layer to be 2 blocks larger. Change the agent move forward from 4 to 6.  

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
})
```

## Step 4

Now, we want the agent to move forward before building the next square so we need to set the place on move to false and have the agent move forward by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
})
```


## Step 5

Next, you can repeat the steps to build the square, however this time you want a 5x5 square instead instead of 7x7 square. First, start with setting the place on move to true. Then create another for loop exactly like the first however have the agent move forward by 4 instead of 6. 
After the for loop, have the agent move up by 1, set assist place on move set to false and have the agent move up by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
})
```


## Step 6

Now, repeat what you did in the last step, but this time to create a 3x3 square.  If the agent moved forward by 6 for a 7x7, and by 4 for a 5x5, how many steps forward should the agent move forward for a 3x3 square. After the for loop for the square, have the agent move up by 1. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  2)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	
})
```

## Step 7

The last step is to have the agent place 1 block to top the pyramid.  Add the code to have the agent place forward to do this. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 

player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  6)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  2)
			agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.place(FORWARD)
})
```
