## Step 1 @unplugged

An **algorithm is a set of instructions that a computer program follows to accomplish a task or solve a problem.** Whenever you write code, you are writing an algorithm. 
The order of the algorithm will determine the outcome. **Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results.** For example, the two algorithms below have the same steps but in different orders.  What do you think will happen in each algorithm.?

**Algorithm 1:**

    player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	    agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	    for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
		    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		}
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	})

**Algorithm 2:**

    player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	    agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	    agent.move(UP,  1)
	    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	    for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
		}
	})



## Step 2 @unplugged

You would have been correct if you said Algorithm 1 will have the agent build a 5x5 square. Algorithm 2 will have the agent build a 5x5 square missing one block, one block in the air. 

While the steps of an algorithm determine the outcome, **algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks**. 

For example, both algorithms below will do the same thing (make a 5x5 square), even though they are written differently. 

**Algorithm 1:**

    player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	    agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	    for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
		    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		}
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	})

**Algorithm 2:**

    player.onChat("run",  function  ()  {
	    agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	    agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	    agent.move(UP,  1)
	})


## Step 3

Algorithms are created in different ways. One way is by **sequencing**, which is **putting steps in order**.  


![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson9/9.1/9.1.JPG?raw=true  "Sequencing")

Let's write a code that uses an algorithm that is developed by sequencing. 

First, create an on chat command called wall. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {

})

```

## Step 4

Next, add the code in the chat command that has the agent set the item of stone at the count of 64 in the slot of 1 in his inventory. And then have the agent have place on move set to true. 
#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)	
})

```

## Step 5

Now, have the agent move forward by 3, up by 1, and back by 3. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)	
	agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(BACK,  3)
})

```

## Step 6

Now, add the code to have the agent move up by 1, forward by 3, and then up by 1.  

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript 
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)	
	agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(BACK,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(BACK,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
})

```

## Step 7

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 8 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat by pressing T. 
3. Type wall and hit enter. 
4. You know your code is correct when the agent builds a 4x4 wall. 

## Step 9

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
