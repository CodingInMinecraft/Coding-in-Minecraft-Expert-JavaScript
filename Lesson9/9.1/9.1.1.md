# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 9 Activity 9.1.1
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1

In the last activity, you learned about sequencing, one way to create an algorithm.  Another way to create an algorithm is through **iteration,** which is **when you do some steps over and over again.**

## Step 2

You learned about iteration when you learned about **loops**.  Below is the code you created for sequencing.  Change it to include iteration by deleting some of the steps and placing others in a loop. 

```template
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)	
	agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(BACK,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(BACK,  3)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
})

```

```javascript 
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
		agent.move(BACK,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	}
})

```


## Step 3

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat by pressing T. 
3. Type wall and hit enter. 
4. You know your code is correct when the agent builds a 4x4 wall. 

## Step 5

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
