# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 9 Activity 9.1.2
### @explicitHints true



## Step 1

In the previous activity, you changed an algorithm that was created by sequencing to one that is created by iteration.  Another way algorithms are created by **selection**.  Selection is when there is **a decision to be made** in the algorithm.  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson9/9.1/9.3.JPG?raw=true  â€œSelection")

You learned about selection when you learned about conditionals.  
Let's convert your code from the last activity into one that makes a decision.  The code from the last activity is below. 



```template
player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
		agent.move(BACK,  3)
		agent.move(UP,  1)
	}
})

```

## Step 2

Let's add a conditional that first checks to see if the there is anything in front of the agent before he begins to build the wall.  If it does not have anything in front of it, have the agent build the wall.  If it does have something in front of it, have the agent destroy forward.

```javascript 

player.onChat("wall",  function  ()  {
	agent.setItem(STONE,  64,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	if  (agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block,  FORWARD))  {
		for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
			agent.move(UP,  1)
			agent.move(BACK,  3)
			agent.move(UP,  1)
		}
	}  else  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
	}
})

```

## Step 3

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. Open the chat by pressing T. 
3. Type wall and hit enter. 
4. You know your code is correct when the agent builds a 4x4 wall. 

## Step 5

When your code works as expected move on to the next NPC. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
