## Step 1 @unplugged

There are certain problems that computers are unable to solve, and even when they can solve a problem, it might take them an unreasonable amount of time to do so. 
**A problem is a general description of a task that can (or cannot) be solved algorithmically.** An instance of a problem also includes specific input. For example, sorting is a problem; sorting the list (2,3,1,7) is an instance of the problem. 

## Step 2 @unplugged

There are two main types of problems: decision problems and optimization problems. **A decision problem is one that can be answered with a simple yes or no** (e.g., determining if there is a path from point A to point B). 
On the other hand, an **optimization problem involves finding the "best" solution among many possibilities** (e.g., identifying the shortest path from point A to point B).

## Step 3 @unplugged

**Algorithmic efficiency refers to how well an algorithm performs in terms of time and resources required to solve a problem.** It measures how quickly an algorithm can find a solution and how much space or memory it needs to do so.

Imagine you have a task to complete, such as sorting a list of numbers. There are different ways to solve this task, and each way is like a different algorithm. Now, algorithmic efficiency is like comparing how fast and efficient these different algorithms are at sorting the list.

## Step 4 @unplugged

When we talk about algorithmic efficiency, we usually consider two main factors: time complexity and space complexity.

**Time complexity is about how much time it takes for an algorithm to run**. It measures how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. For example, if we have a list with 10 numbers, how long does the algorithm take to sort it? If we have a list with 100 numbers, does the algorithm take longer? **Algorithms with better time complexity are faster and more efficient.**

**Space complexity refers to how much memory or space an algorithm needs to solve a problem.** It measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases. **Efficient algorithms use minimal space or memory,** which is important when dealing with large amounts of data.

## Step 5 @unplugged

To understand algorithmic efficiency, think of it like choosing the best way to solve a problem. **You want to find an algorithm that can solve the problem quickly and with minimal resources.** It's like finding the fastest route to school or the most efficient way to complete a task, but in the context of algorithms and computer science.

**By analyzing and comparing the efficiency of different algorithms, we can choose the most suitable one for a given problem.** This helps us optimize the performance of our programs, saving time and resources in the process.

## Step 6 @unplugged

**An algorithmâ€™s efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes**.

Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to find the sum of all the numbers in the list. You can write an algorithm to accomplish this task. One way to do it is to use a loop that iterates through each number in the list and adds it to a running total.

If we have a list with 5 numbers as in the example above, the statement will execute 5 times. If we have a list with 10 numbers, the statement will execute 10 times.

**By counting the number of times a statement or group of statements executes, we can get an idea of how the algorithm's efficiency scales with the input size.** In this case, the efficiency is directly related to the number of elements in the list.

## Step 7 @unplugged

 Different correct algorithms for the same problem can have different efficiencies. 
  **Polynomial efficiency is a way to measure how well an algorithm performs in terms of time as the size of the problem increases**. It tells us how the running time of an algorithm grows with the input size.

Imagine you have a problem to solve, like sorting a list of numbers. There are different algorithms to solve this problem, and we want to know how fast they are. Polynomial efficiency helps us understand that.

When we talk about polynomial efficiency, we look at the time complexity of an algorithm. **Time complexity tells us how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases**. We use mathematical expressions called polynomials to describe this growth.

## Step 8 @unplugged

Algorithms with **exponential or factorial efficiencies** are examples of algorithms that run in an **unreasonable amount of time.**

   Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficient algorithm for solving them. In these cases, approximate solutions are sought. 
   
   A **heuristic** is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that is **not guaranteed to be optimal but may be used when techniques that are guaranteed to always find an optimal solution are impractical.**
