## Step 1 @unplugged

  We need to help the team lay down a foundation for the video game they are creating. Let's use the 'for' loop to place some blocks in a pattern. Walk to the open area, then click next to begin your code.



## Step 2

Great job beginning to lay down the foundation. Now that we know about agent.move and placing on move, let's try to expand. We want to make a foundation of sand with a 10x10 area. Right now, your agent is only making on line. Use agent.move(LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, FOWARD, or BACK) to plan out how to lay the 10x10 sand foundation. Use as many loops as possible.
