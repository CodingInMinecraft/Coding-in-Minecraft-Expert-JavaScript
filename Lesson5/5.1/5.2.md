# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 5 Activity 5.2

## Step 1 @unplugged

  We need to help the team lay down a foundation for the video game they are creating. Let's use the 'for' loop to place some blocks in a pattern. Walk to the open area, then click next to begin your code.



## Step 2

In Minecraft, we can use the command agent.setAssist to create a Boolean that requires the agent to PLACE_ON_MOVE when the conditions remain true. We can also use agent.move to define how many blocks forward an agent can move and place blocks before the task is finished. 


  

## Step 3

Using the template below, define the 'for' loop so that the agent moves forward 10 times.

  ```template

    agent.setItem(SAND,  64,  1)

    for  (let )  {
    
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
    
    agent.move(FORWARD,  1)

}
```

```javascript

    agent.setItem(SAND,  64,  1)
    
    for  (let index =  0; index <  10; index++)  {
    
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
    
    agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
    
    }

```

  

## Step 4@unplugged

Run your code, and watch your agent move forward and place a block each of the 10 moves. 

  


## Step 5 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when the agent moves forward and places a block down 10 times.
  
  
  

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
