## Step 1 @unplugged

  We need to help the team lay down a foundation for the video game they are creating. Let's use the 'for' loop to place some blocks in a pattern. Walk to the open area, then click next to begin your code.



## Step 2 @unplugged

In Minecraft, we can use the command agent.setAssist to create a Boolean that requires the agent to PLACE_ON_MOVE when the conditions remain true. We can also use agent.move to define how many blocks forward an agent can move and place blocks before the task is finished. 


  

## Step 3

You are going to create a code that agent moves forward 10 times and has it place down as it moves. 

First, use the set assist code to give the agent 64 SAND blocks in slot 1. Then create the code to have the agent place on move. 

Then create a for loop. In the loop, condition 1 should define the variable index and assigning it the value of 0. Condition 2 should be less than 10, and then condition 3 should increase the index by 1 each iteration.  


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

    agent.setItem(SAND,  64,  1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
    
    for  (let index =  0; index <  10; index++)  {
    

    
    }

```

  

## Step 4

Next, inside the loop, have the agent move forward by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

    agent.setItem(SAND,  64,  1)
    agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
    
    for  (let index =  0; index <  10; index++)  {
        agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
    
    }

```



## Step 5 @unplugged

Run your code, and watch your agent move forward and place a block each of the 10 moves. 

  


## Step 6 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when the agent moves forward and places a block down 10 times.
  
  
  

## Step 7

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
