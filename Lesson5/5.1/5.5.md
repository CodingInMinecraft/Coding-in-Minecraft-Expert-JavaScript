## Step 1 @unplugged

For this activity, we are going to auto harvest some crops using a while loop. First, we need to define cropType as blocks.wheat, and define the area to plant crops by calculating the X, Z, and height coordinates relative to your agent.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let cropType = blocks.wheat;
let startX = 5;
let startZ = 5;
let endX = 10;
let endZ = 10;
let height = 64;
```



## Step 2

Now, we will use current coordinates and start coordinates to to specify where the crops will be planted, then we will use a while loop to begin placing.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let cropType = blocks.wheat;
let startX = 5;
let startZ = 5;
let endX = 10;
let endZ = 10;
let height = 64;
let currentX = startX; let currentZ = startZ; while (currentX <= endX) { while (currentZ <= endZ) { agent.setSlot(1); agent.place(currentX, height, currentZ); currentZ++; } currentX++; currentZ = startZ; }
```

## Step 3

Let's add onto our code and add in the wait time for our crops. The time should be defined in milliseconds, but should represent 30 seconds. use waitingTime and startTime to to defined the wait time.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let cropType = blocks.wheat;
let startX = 5;
let startZ = 5;
let endX = 10;
let endZ = 10;
let height = 64;
let currentX = startX; let currentZ = startZ; while (currentX <= endX) { while (currentZ <= endZ) { agent.setSlot(1); agent.place(currentX, height, currentZ); currentZ++; } currentX++; currentZ = startZ; }
let waitingTime = 30000; 
 let startTime = control.millis(); 

while (control.millis() - startTime < waitingTime) {  }


```

## Step 4

Now that we have defined the wait time, we want to have our agent harvest the crops that have grown. Add on a currentX = startX; then we will add a while loop to have our agent.destory the blocks at the specified coordinates.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let cropType = blocks.wheat;
let startX = 5;
let startZ = 5;
let endX = 10;
let endZ = 10;
let height = 64;
let currentX = startX; let currentZ = startZ; while (currentX <= endX) { while (currentZ <= endZ) { agent.setSlot(1); agent.place(currentX, height, currentZ); currentZ++; } currentX++; currentZ = startZ; }
let waitingTime = 30000; 
 let startTime = control.millis(); 

while (control.millis() - startTime < waitingTime) {  }

currentX = startX; 
while (currentX <= endX) { 
while (currentZ <= endZ) { agent.destroy(currentX, height, currentZ); currentZ++; } currentX++; currentZ = startZ; }


```
## Step 5

Lastly, let's add in a player.say command to let us know our crops are planted and harvested when done.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let cropType = blocks.wheat;
let startX = 5;
let startZ = 5;
let endX = 10;
let endZ = 10;
let height = 64;
let currentX = startX; let currentZ = startZ; while (currentX <= endX) { while (currentZ <= endZ) { agent.setSlot(1); agent.place(currentX, height, currentZ); currentZ++; } currentX++; currentZ = startZ; }
let waitingTime = 30000; 
 let startTime = control.millis(); 

while (control.millis() - startTime < waitingTime) {  }

currentX = startX; 
while (currentX <= endX) { 
while (currentZ <= endZ) { agent.destroy(currentX, height, currentZ); currentZ++; } currentX++; currentZ = startZ; }
player.say("Crops planted and harvested!");


```


  


## Step 6 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

  

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 7

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
