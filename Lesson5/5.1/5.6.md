## Step 1 @unplugged

For this activity, we are going to auto mine the blocks in front of us. Let's start by defining the start coordinates for your agent. Make sure to define a startX, Y, and Z.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
 let startX = 10; 
 let startY = 64; 
 let startZ = 10; 
```



## Step 2

Now, let's define the number of blocks to mine in each direction. Take time to count out the maximum length, width, and depth of the the mining area. Once counted, define the numbers using mineLength, mineWidth, and mineDepth.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
 let startX = 10; 
 let startY = 64; 
 let startZ = 10; 
 
for (let x = startX; x < startX + mineLength; x++) {
        for (let z = startZ; z < startZ + mineWidth; z++) {
            for (let y = startY; y > startY - mineDepth; y--) {
```

## Step 3

Lastly, let's add in an agent.destroy command that has your agent destroy blocks at the specific x, y, and z coordinates.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
 let startX = 10; 
 let startY = 64; 
 let startZ = 10; 
 
for (let x = startX; x < startX + mineLength; x++) {
        for (let z = startZ; z < startZ + mineWidth; z++) {
            for (let y = startY; y > startY - mineDepth; y--) {
 agent.destroyBlock(x, y, z); 

```



## Step 4 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 5

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
