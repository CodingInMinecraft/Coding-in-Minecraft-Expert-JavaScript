## Step 1 @unplugged

For this activity, we are going to auto mine the blocks in front of us. Let's start by defining the start coordinates for your agent. Make sure to define a startX, Y, and Z.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
 let startX = 10; 
 let startY = 64; 
 let startZ = 10; 
```



## Step 2

Now, let's define the number of blocks to mine in each direction. Take time to count out the maximum length, width, and depth of the the mining area. Once counted, define the numbers using mineLength, mineWidth, and mineDepth.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
 let startX = 10; 
 let startY = 64; 
 let startZ = 10; 
 
for (let x = startX; x < startX + mineLength; x++) {
        for (let z = startZ; z < startZ + mineWidth; z++) {
            for (let y = startY; y > startY - mineDepth; y--) {
```

## Step 3

Lastly, let's add in an agent.destroy command that has your agent destroy blocks at the specific x, y, and z coordinates.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
 let startX = 10; 
 let startY = 64; 
 let startZ = 10; 
 
for (let x = startX; x < startX + mineLength; x++) {
        for (let z = startZ; z < startZ + mineWidth; z++) {
            for (let y = startY; y > startY - mineDepth; y--) {
 agent.destroyBlock(x, y, z); 

```



## Step 4 
Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 5 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2. You will know your code is correct when you see the agent breaks the blocks of the structure on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
