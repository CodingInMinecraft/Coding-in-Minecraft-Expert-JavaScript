# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 5 Activity 5.8


### @explicitHints true

  


## Step 1

For this activity, we will use the code from our previous activity, but change out the 'for' loops for 'while' loops. Use the template below to define the while loops. Your desired result is that the while loops count and display the desired mined block.


```template

```javascript
let targetBlock = blocks.diamond_ore;
 let startX = 10;
    let startZ = 10; 
    let endX = 20;  
    let endZ = 20;  
    let height = 64;
  let x = startX;
    while () {
        let ;
        while () {
            let ;
            while () {
                if (blocks.testForBlock(targetBlock, positions.createWorld(x, y, z))) {
                    agent.collect(targetBlock, 1);
                    blocks.destroy(targetBlock, positions.createWorld(x, y, z));
                }
                y--;
            }
            z++;
        }
        x++;
    }
```

```javascript
let targetBlock = blocks.diamond_ore;
 let startX = 10;
    let startZ = 10; 
    let endX = 20;  
    let endZ = 20;  
    let height = 64;
          let x = startX;
    while (x <= endX) {
        let z = startZ;
        while (z <= endZ) {
            let y = height;
            while (y >= 1) {
                if (blocks.testForBlock(targetBlock, positions.createWorld(x, y, z))) {
                    agent.collect(targetBlock, 1);
                    blocks.destroy(targetBlock, positions.createWorld(x, y, z));
                }
                y--;
            }
            z++;
        }
        x++;
    }


```

## Step 2 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

  

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 3

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
