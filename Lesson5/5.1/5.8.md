## Step 1

Loop controls are mechanisms in programming languages that allow you to manipulate the flow of loops. They help you determine when to continue, break out of, or skip iterations within a loop.

 Common loop controls include:
1.	Break: The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, regardless of whether the loop condition is still true or not. When encountered, it immediately terminates the loop and continues execution with the next statement after the loop.
2.	Continue: The continue statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. It's often used to skip specific iterations based on certain conditions without exiting the loop entirely.
3.	Return: In some languages, you can use the return statement to exit a function early, which effectively exits any loop within that function as well.
These loop controls provide flexibility and allow you to create more complex loop behavior to suit different programming needs.
