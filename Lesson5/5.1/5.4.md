## Step 1 @unplugged

  

Another important loop to look at is the JavaScript 'while' loop. The 'while' loop will allow a code to run until a specific condition is met. As long as the condition remains true, the code will run.


## Step 2

Now create a loop using the player.say command to count up to the number 10 in the chat. Start by letting i=0 inside of the 'for' loop. Finish the variable with a semicolon symbol.

```javascript

for (let i=0;

  

```

  

## Step 3

Next we want to define a loop repeat amount. Using a less than operator, define condition 2 to be less than 10. Add a semicolon after condition 2.

  

#### ~ tutorialhint

  

```javascript

for(let i=0; i<10;

```

  

## Step 4

Next, we need to define condition 3 by addition in an increasing expression (i++), and ending our loop with a parentheses.

  

#### ~ tutorialhint

  

```javascript

for(let i=0;i<10;1++)

player.say(i)

```

  

## Step 5 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
