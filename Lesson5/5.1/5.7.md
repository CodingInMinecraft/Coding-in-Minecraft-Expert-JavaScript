# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 5 Activity 5.7

## Step 1 @unplugged

For this activity, we are going to count and display specific blocks in the space using for loops. Let's start by setting our desired block to diamond_ore.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let targetBlock = blocks.diamond_ore;
```



## Step 2

Now, let's define the are that our agent will search using relative coordinates to your agent's starting position. We need to define a start and end point for our X and Z coordinate, and define a height.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let targetBlock = blocks.diamond_ore;
 let startX = 10;
    let startZ = 10; 
    let endX = 20;  
    let endZ = 20;  
    let height = 64;
```

## Step 3

Now, let's use what we know about for loops to loop through the desired area. We will need a loop for each of the defined coordinates.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let targetBlock = blocks.diamond_ore;
 let startX = 10;
    let startZ = 10; 
    let endX = 20;  
    let endZ = 20;  
    let height = 64;
        for (let x = startX; x <= endX; x++) {
        for (let z = startZ; z <= endZ; z++) {
            for (let y = height; y >= 1; y--) {

```

## Step 4

Lastly, we need some parameters that will test our block position, and if it is our desired block, we will need our agent to collect it. Use the tutorial hint if you get stuck.


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let targetBlock = blocks.diamond_ore;
 let startX = 10;
    let startZ = 10; 
    let endX = 20;  
    let endZ = 20;  
    let height = 64;
        for (let x = startX; x <= endX; x++) {
        for (let z = startZ; z <= endZ; z++) {
            for (let y = height; y >= 1; y--) {
                            if (blocks.testForBlock(targetBlock, positions.createWorld(x, y, z))) {
                    agent.collect(targetBlock, 1);
                    blocks.destroy(targetBlock, positions.createWorld(x, y, z));
                }
            }
        }
    }


```


## Step 5 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

  

You will know your code is correct when you see the text 1 appear on your screen.

  
  
  

## Step 6

If your code worked as expected move on to the next activity.

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
