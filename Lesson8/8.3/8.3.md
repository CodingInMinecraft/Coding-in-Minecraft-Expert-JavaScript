## Step 1 @unplugged
Another type of collection is an object. In JavaScript, **an object is like a container that lets you organize and store different pieces of information.** Think of it like a real-world object â€“ for example, a car. A car can have various properties like color, model, and year, and it can perform actions like starting or stopping. Similarly, a JavaScript object groups related information together.

## Step 2 @unplugged
An object is made up of **key-value pairs**. Each key is like a label, and each value is the actual information. For example:

javascript
Copy code
let car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: 2022,
    color: "Blue"
};
Here, brand, model, year, and color are the keys, and "Toyota", "Camry", 2022, and "Blue" are their corresponding values.
