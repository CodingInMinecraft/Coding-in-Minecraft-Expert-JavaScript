# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 8 Activity 8.1

### @explicitHints true

## Step 1 @unplugged
We are going to continue our work with arrays. When working with arrays, you can access individual elements in the array using their index. In JavaScript, indices start from 0. So, fruits[0] gives you the first fruit in the array below.

let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

## Step 2
Let's practice accessing the elements from our first array, which has been added below for you. 

Start by changing the code in the player say.  We want the player to say the number in the 0 place.  So the code will be:

numbers[0]

```template
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers.length)

```

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers [0])
```

## Step 3
Next, Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 4 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  You will know your code is correct when your player says the number 2.  
3.  If your code works correctly, move onto the next step. If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.


### Step 5
We can also change the value of an element in the array by assigning a new value to it. Let's update the code we have.  First, change the player.say to say the number in the 1 place.  


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers[1])
```

## Step 6
Now, change the number that is in the 1 place with the number 5 with the following code:

numbers[1] = 5

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers[1])
numbers[1] = 5
```

## Step 7
Now, have the player say the number that is in the 1 place. 


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers[1])
numbers[1] = 5
player.say(numbers[1])
```


## Step 8

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 9 @unplugged
To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

1.  You will know your code is correct when your player says the number 3. And then the player will say 5. (This is because the number in the 1 spot was originally 3 and then we changed it to 5.)
2.  If your code works correctly, move onto the next step. If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
