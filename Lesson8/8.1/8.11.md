2.  **Sets:** Sets are collection types that store unique values, meaning that each value can occur only once within the set. Unlike arrays, sets are unordered, and the order of elements is not guaranteed. Here's an example of a set:


```javascript
    const colors = new Set(["red", "green", "blue"]);
```

Sets have methods for adding, deleting, and checking the presence of elements, such as `add()`, `delete()`, and `has()`.

3.  **Maps:** Maps are collections that store key-value pairs, where each value is associated with a unique key. Maps allow you to store and retrieve values based on their keys, providing a more flexible alternative to arrays. Here's an example of a map:



```javascript
    const user = new Map();
user.set("name", "John");
user.set("age", 25);
```

Maps have methods for adding, deleting, and retrieving values based on keys, such as `set()`, `delete()`, and `get()`.

4.  **WeakSet and WeakMap:** WeakSet and WeakMap are special collection types in JavaScript that have limited use cases. They are similar to sets and maps, respectively, but with some important differences. WeakSets and WeakMaps allow you to store only objects as keys, and they do not prevent the objects from being garbage collected by JavaScript's memory management system.

These are the basic collection types in JavaScript. Each collection type has its own characteristics and methods for manipulation and retrieval of data. Choosing the right collection type depends on your specific use case and requirements.

It's important to note that in addition to these built-in collections, JavaScript also provides various methods and functionalities for working with collections, such as iterating over elements using loops (`for...of`), using array methods like `filter()`, `map()`, and more.

Understanding collections is fundamental for organizing and managing data in JavaScript, and they are widely used in many programming tasks.


  



 we can make the agent move a certain number of blocks based on the element chosen in the array. 
Let's try this out by first adding the code to make the agent move forward by 1. 

#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers [0])
agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
```

### Step 4
Delete the 1 in the agent move forward code and replace it with the following code:
numbers[0]


#### ~ tutorialhint

```javascript
let numbers = [2,3,7,9]
player.say(numbers [0])
agent.move(FORWARD, numbers[0])
```

## Step 5

2.  You will know your code is correct when your player says the number 2. And then the agent moves forward by 2 blocks. 
3.  If your code works correctly, move onto the next step. If it not down work as expected, try to fix and test again.
