# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 12 Activity 2
### @explicitHints true

## Step 1
We are going to create code for a game that updates the score based on what block the player breaks.  If the score is not exactly equal to 10, a new random block will appear.  Each color block has a different value. 

Let's begin by creating a variable named score and assigning it the value of 0.  Then create a list named colors with the following blocks:
Yellow Wool, Blue Wool, Red Wool, and Purple Wool. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript 

let score = 0
let colors = [YELLOW_WOOL, PURPLE_WOOL, RED_WOOL, BLUE_WOOL]
```

## Step 2

Create a function called newBlock.  Inside the function, create a blocks placed code, that will pick a Random color block from the colors list and place it at the following coordinate. (It will have the block be placed a random position anywhere in the activity zone.)

world(randint(-398,-404), 68, randint(196,190))

Then we need to create a loop that runs 4 times that calls the new block function.  This will give you 4 blocks to start the game with. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score = 0
let colors = [YELLOW_WOOL, PURPLE_WOOL, RED_WOOL, BLUE_WOOL]
function newBlock() {
    blocks.place(colors._pickRandom(), world(randint(-398, -404), 68, randint(196, 190)))
}
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    newBlock()
}
```

## Step 3

Now, we need to create an on blocks broken code for all of the different block colors.  Start with the Yellow Wool. 
Inside the on blocks broken code, have the score increase by 2. 
Then, create an if / else statement.  Have the statement check if the score is equal to 10.  If it is true, have the player say "You win with a score of " the variable score. 
If it doesn't equal 10, have the player say "Your score is" the variable score. And then call the function newBlock. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score = 0
let colors = [YELLOW_WOOL, PURPLE_WOOL, RED_WOOL, BLUE_WOOL]
function newBlock() {
    blocks.place(colors._pickRandom(), world(randint(-398, -404), 68, randint(196, 190)))
}
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    newBlock()
}

blocks.onBlockBroken(YELLOW_WOOL, function on_block_broken_yellow_wool() {
    
    score += 2
    if (score == 10) {
        player.say("You win with a score of " + ("" + ("" + score)))
    } else {
        player.say("Your score is " + ("" + ("" + score)))
        newBlock()
    }
    
})
```

## Step 4

Next, you will create on blocks broken codes for the other wool colors in the list. All of the code for each color is the same as the yellow you created on the last step, except for the score change.  
For the blue wool have the score increase by 1. 
For the red wool, have the score increase by 3. 
For the purple wool, have the score decrease by 1. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let score = 0
let colors = [YELLOW_WOOL, PURPLE_WOOL, RED_WOOL, BLUE_WOOL]

function newBlock() {
    blocks.place(colors._pickRandom(), world(randint(-398, -404), 68, randint(196, 190)))
}

for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    newBlock()
}

blocks.onBlockBroken(YELLOW_WOOL, function on_block_broken_yellow_wool() {
    
    score += 2
    if (score == 10) {
        player.say("You win with a score of " + ("" + ("" + score)))
    } else {
        player.say("Your score is " + ("" + ("" + score)))
        newBlock()
    }
    
})
blocks.onBlockBroken(BLUE_WOOL, function on_block_broken_blue_wool() {
    
    score += 1
    if (score == 10) {
        player.say("You win with a score of " + ("" + ("" + score)))
    } else {
        player.say("Your score is " + ("" + ("" + score)))
        newBlock()
    }
    
})

blocks.onBlockBroken(PURPLE_WOOL, function on_block_broken_purple_wool() {
    
    score += -1
    if (score == 10) {
        player.say("You win with a score of " + ("" + ("" + score)))
    } else {
        player.say("Your score is " + ("" + ("" + score)))
        newBlock()
    }
    
})
blocks.onBlockBroken(RED_WOOL, function on_block_broken_red_wool() {
    
    score += 3
    if (score == 10) {
        player.say("You win with a score of " + ("" + ("" + score)))
    } else {
        player.say("Your score is " + ("" + ("" + score)))
        newBlock()
    }
    
})

```

## Step 5

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 6 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  Play the game by breaking blocks.  
3.  You will know your code is correct when the player says your score after each block broken and randomly spawns a blocks when the score is not 10.  When the score is 10, your player will say "You win with a score of 10."
