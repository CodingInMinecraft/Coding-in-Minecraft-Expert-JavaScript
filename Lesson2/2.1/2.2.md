## Comparison Operators

## Step 1 @unplugged

In JavaScript, comparison operators are used to compare values, and return a Boolean value(true or false). Here are some examples of the different comparison operators in JavaScript:

1. **equal to(==)** : The equality operator will check if two values are equal.
2. **not equal to (!=)** : the inequality operator checks if two values are NOT equal.
3. **strict equal to (===)** : the strict equality operator checks if two values are equal by comparing both the value and the data type.
4. **strict not equal to (!==)**: the strict inequality operator checks if two values are not equal by comparing both the value and the data type.
5. **greater than (>)** : the greater than operator check if the left operand is greater than the right operand
6. **less than (<)** : the less than operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand

Typically, comparison operators are used in conditional statement and comparisons to make decisions based on certain conditions. The goal of comparison operators is to return a Boolean value of true or false, to make decisions. 

## Step 2

Let's use a few different comparison operators and see what happens. For this activity, we will use the player.say command. First, have the player say (3>5) to test out the greater than operator. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
    player.say(3>5)
```

## Step 3
Test your code by pressing the green button. You should see a Boolean response in the chat. Return to this coding screen once you have successfully ran your code. 


## Step 4

Great job. Your player should have said "false" when testing if three was great than 5. 
Next, let's test a less than operator with the same numbers, in the same order, and repeat the process of checking for a Boolean response after you write your code.

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
    player.say(3<5)
```


## Step 5 


Awesome! You should have seen that the player gave back a 'true' Boolean response, showing that 3 in less than 5. 

Lastly, check an equal to operator with numbers of your choice. Once tested, you should see a Boolean response in the chat depending on the numbers that you put!


## Step 6 @unplugged

Now run the code by clicking the **green start button** in the bottom right of the MakeCode screen.

You will know your code is correct when you see the text "What a nice day" appear on your screen.
 

When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.  

## Step 7

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.

  

Now that you have learned about arithmetic operators, continue to the next activity to learn about comparison operators.
