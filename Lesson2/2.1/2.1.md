## Step 1 @unplugged

In JavaScript, operators are keywords or symbols that are used to perform various operations on values. These operations include performing arithmetic operations, assigning values, comparing values, and more!
The most common operations in JavaScript are:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. and Conditional(ternary) Operators

Interact with the buttons below to learn more.

## Step 2 @unplugged
Arithmetic Operators are used to perform mathematical operations on number values. The operations are:
(+) Addition
(-) Subtraction
(*)Multiplication
(/) Division
(%)Modulus

Here's an example of what these may look like:


```javascript
    let x=13;
    let y=7;
    let z= x+y; // z will equal 20
    let a= x*y; // a will equal 91
    let b= x-y // b will equal 6
```

## Step 3
In the space below, let's use an arithmetic operator to string together our full name. Create a variable called fullName.
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
    let fullName =
```


## Step 3

Using an addition operator, add together the string "your first name" and "your last name" so that the player will say your first and last name in one command. Make sure to add a space after your first name, so that there is a space when the code is ran. 
#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
    let fullName= "Melanie " + "Drown"
```


## Step 4

Add a player.say command to the second line of your code, and have the player say the variable "fullName"

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
     let fullName= "Melanie " + "Drown"
     player.say(fullName)
```


## Step 5 @unplugged

To test your code:

2. You will know your code is correct when you see the your first and last name  appear on your screen.

  

3. When your code works as expected move on to the next activity.

  

## Step 5

  

If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.

  

Now that you have learned about arithmetic operators, continue to the next activity to learn about comparison operators.
