Assignment Operators are an imperative aspect of writing lines of code in JavaScript. You will continue to learn and use assignment operators throughout the entire course. Assignment Operators are used to assign values to variables. They combine the task of assigning a value with an arithmetic or logical operation. Assignment operators allow you to update the value of a variable based on its previous value. 

Continue on to learn about different assignment operators.

## Step 2 @unplugged
The most commonly used assignment operators in JavaScript are:

1. Assignment (=) operator: This assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.

Syntax: variable=value

2. Addition assignment (+=) operator: This operator adds the value on the right side to the existing value of the variable, and assigns the results back to the variable.

Syntax: variable += value

3. Subtraction assignment (-=) operator: This operator subtracts the value on the right side from the existing value of the variable and assigns results back to the variable.

Syntax: variable -= value

There are more assignment operators that mimic the above pattern and result including multiplication assignment operator (*=) and Division assignment operator (/=).
