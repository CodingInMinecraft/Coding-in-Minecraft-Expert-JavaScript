# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3 Activity 3.1.2
### @explicitHints true


## Step 1

In this activity, we will use an if statement to write "Happy Halloween" in the sky after we decorate with 4 Jack-o-lanterns. 
Start by declaring the variable decorate and assigning it the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
``` javascript

let decorate =  0

```

## Step 2

In this activity, we will use the event handler of on Block Placed.  Below is the code for that event. 

blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {

})

Add the on Blocks Placed code and change the block from Grass to Jack_O_Lantern. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let decorate = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {

})
```

## Step 3

AFter the on blocks placed code, create a code that increases the variable by 1 each time a Jack_O_Lantern block down inside the event. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let decorate = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {
	decorate +=  1
})

```

## Step 4

AFter the decorate code, write an If Statement with the condition that the decorate variable's modulus of 4 is equal to 0. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let decorate = 0

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let decorate = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {
	decorate +=  1
	if  (decorate %  4  ==  0)  {
	}
})

```

## Step 5

Now we want to add to the If statement the code we want to run if the conditional is true.  We want to have the words "Happy Halloween" printed in the sky. 
We want Happy to be above Halloween so we will do this in 2 steps. 
The code for printing with blocks is below. 

blocks.print("text", BLOCK, pos(0,0,0), DIRECTION)

Add the code above with the text of "Happy", the Block of GLOWSTONE, the position of (-7,10,-15), and the direction of East inside the if statement. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {
    decorate += 1
    if (decorate % 4 == 0) {
        blocks.print("Happy", GLOWSTONE, pos(-7, 10, -15),EAST)
    }
})
```


## Step 6

Lastly add let's add the word Halloween with the same blocks.print code we did with Happy but with the position of (-15, 5, -15).

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {
    decorate += 1
    if (decorate % 4 == 0) {
        blocks.print("Happy", GLOWSTONE, pos(-7, 10, -15),EAST)
        blocks.print("Halloween", GLOWSTONE, pos(-15, 5, -15), EAST)
    }
})
```

## Step 7

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 8 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

2.  Place down 4 Jack-O-Lantern. 
3. You know your code works correctly when you see "Happy Halloween" printed in the sky. 

## Step 9

When your code works as expected move on to the next NPC. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
