# Expert Coding using JavaScript - Lesson 3 Activity 3.1.2
### @explicitHints true


## Step 1

In this activity, we will use an if statement to write "Boo!" in the sky after we decorate with 4 Jack-o-lanterns. 
Start by declaring the variable decorate and assigning it the value of 0. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
``` javascript

let decorate =  0

```

## Step 2

In this activity, we will use the event handler of on Block Placed.  Below is the code for that event. 

blocks.onBlockPlaced(GRASS,  function  ()  {

})

Add the on Blocks Placed code and change the block from Grass to Jack_O_Lantern. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript
let decorate = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {

})
```

## Step 3

AFter the on blocks placed code, create a code that increases the variable by 1 each time a Jack_O_Lantern block down inside the event. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let decorate = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {
	decorate +=  1
})

```

## Step 4

After the decorate code, write an If Statement with the condition that the decorate variable's modulus of 4 is equal to 0. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let decorate = 0
blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {
	decorate +=  1
	if  (decorate %  4  ==  0)  {
	}
})

```

## Step 5

Now we want to add to the If statement the code we want to run if the conditional is true.  We want to have the word "Boo!" printed in the sky. 
The code for printing with blocks is below. 

blocks.print("text", BLOCK, pos(0,0,0), DIRECTION)

Add the code above with the text of "Boo!", the Block of GLOWSTONE, the position of (-163, 77, 59), and the direction of East inside the if statement. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

blocks.onBlockPlaced(JACK_O_LANTERN, function () {
    decorate += 1
    if (decorate % 4 == 0) {
        blocks.print("Boo!", GLOWSTONE, pos(-163, 77, 59),EAST)
    }
})
```



## Step 6

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.


## Step 7 @unplugged

2.  Place down 4 Jack-O-Lantern. 
3. You know your code works correctly when you see "Boo!" printed in the sky. 

## Step 8

When your code works as expected move on to the next NPC. 
If it does not work as expected, try to fix and test again.
