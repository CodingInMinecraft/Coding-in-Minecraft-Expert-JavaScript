## Step 1

You have now built the aquarium and we need to fill it with water and fish.  

We have placed the code for clearing and building the aquarium on your workspace. *We have shortened it somewhat for you to make it easier to work.*

```template
player.onChat("clear",  function  ()  {
	for  (let index =  0; index <  5; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
		agent.destroy(FORWARD)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}  else  {
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	}
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		if  (agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block,  FORWARD)  ==  GRASS)  {
			agent.destroy(FORWARD)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}  else  {
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
	}
})
player.onChat("base",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GLASS)  {
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
	}  else  {

	}
})
player.onChat("base",  function  ()  {
	if  (agent.getItemDetail(1)  ==  GLASS)  {
		for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
			agent.destroy(DOWN)
			agent.place(DOWN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
			agent.destroy(DOWN)
			agent.place(DOWN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
			agent.destroy(DOWN)
			agent.place(DOWN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
	}  else  {
		agent.setItem(GLASS,  64,  1)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
			agent.destroy(DOWN)
			agent.place(DOWN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
			agent.destroy(DOWN)
			agent.place(DOWN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		for  (let index =  0; index <  2; index++)  {
			agent.destroy(DOWN)
			agent.place(DOWN)
			agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
		}
		agent.destroy(DOWN)
		agent.place(DOWN)
	}
})
player.onChat("outside",  function  ()  {
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  3)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  3; index++)  {
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	for  (let index =  0; index <  4; index++)  {
		agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
		agent.move(FORWARD,  4)
	}
	agent.move(UP,  1)
})
```


## Step 2

Our first step is to create an on chat command called water. Inside the chat command,  turn off agent place on move so the agent doesn't place down glass blocks inside the aquarium. Then turn the agent right and move forward by 1.  Then move the agent down 3 to get to the bottom of the aquarium.  

After that code, change the active slot of the agent to slot 2, which contains the water bucket.  The code for that looks like this:

    agent.setSlot(2)



#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

player.onChat("water",  function  ()  {
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.move(DOWN,  3)
	agent.setSlot(2)

})

```

## Step 3

After the slot has been changed to slot 2, add an agent place on move and set it to true.  Then move the agent around the aquarium to fill with water.  Use the following directions to fill it to the top evenly. 

 - Move right 2 times
 - Move forward 2 times
 - Move up 1 time
 - Move left 2 times
 - Move back 2 times
 - Move up 1 time
 - Move right 2 times
 - Move forward 2 times

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

player.onChat("water",  function  ()  {
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  false)
	agent.turn(RIGHT_TURN)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  1)
	agent.move(DOWN,  3)
	agent.setSlot(2)
	agent.setAssist(PLACE_ON_MOVE,  true)
	agent.move(RIGHT,  2)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  2)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(LEFT,  2)
	agent.move(BACK,  2)
	agent.move(UP,  1)
	agent.move(RIGHT,  2)
	agent.move(FORWARD,  2)
})

```

## Step 4

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 5 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

2. Reset the area. 
3. Open the chat and type clear. 
4. After the area is clear, type move to move the agent into the correct position. 
5. Once the agent is in the correct spot, type base. 
6.  Once the agent builds base, type outside to build the outside of the aquarium. 
7. After the outside is built, type water to fill the aquarium. 
8. You will know your code is correct when the aquarium is built and filled with water. 

## Step 6

If your code works as expected, click next to go on to step 7.  If not, go back and fix your code. 

## Step 7

Now it is time to fill the the aquarium with fish.  We are going to write the code using a chat command and use an if statement to check how many fish we have added to the aquarium as well. 
First, declare a variable named fish and assign it the value of 0. 
Then add a chat command named fish. 

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let fish =  0
player.onChat("fish",  function  ()  {
	
})
```

## Step 8

Next, inside the chat command, set the agent's active slot to slot 3 (which contains the tropical fish).  
After you set the active slot, have the agent place forward.  Then we want to have the variable fish increase by 1. 


#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let fish =  0
player.onChat("fish",  function  ()  {
	agent.setSlot(3)
	agent.place(FORWARD)
	fish +=  1
	
})
```

## Step 9

Now, we want to add an if /else statement in the chat command.  Have the if statement check to see if the variable fish equals to or is greater than  5.  
If it is equal to or greater than 5, have the player say "Your aquarium is full." If it is not equal to or greater than 5, have the player say, "You only have (the variable fish) fish."

#### ~ tutorialhint
```javascript

let fish =  0
player.onChat("fish",  function  ()  {
	agent.setSlot(3)
	agent.place(FORWARD)
	fish +=  1
	if  (fish >=  5)  {
		player.say("Your Aquarium is full!")
	}  else  {
		player.say("You only have "  + fish +  " fish")
	}
})
```

## Step 10

Run the code by following the instructions in the next step.

## Step 11 @unplugged

To test your code:
Once you have fully read this step click the Green Ok button below to close this window to return to the tutorial to perform the below steps to test your code.

1. Click on the **Green Start button** below to return to the game.

  

![alt text](https://expertjs.codingcredentials.com/Lesson1/1.1/1.JPG?raw=true  "Start")

2. Reset the area. 
3. Open the chat and type clear. 
4. After the area is clear, type move to move the agent into the correct position. 
5. Once the agent is in the correct spot, type base. 
6.  Once the agent builds base, type outside to build the outside of the aquarium. 
7. After the outside is built, type water to fill the aquarium. 
8. After the water fills the aquarium, type fish. 
9. You should see the player say You only have 1 fish.
10. Type fish 4 more times. 
11. At the 5th time, you should see you player say Your aquarium is full!
12. You will know your code is correct when the aquarium is built and filled with water and 5 fish and your player says Your aquarium is full.
